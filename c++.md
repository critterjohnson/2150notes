# C++

- preprocessor - incldues things

## Operators and Expressions
- inside of an if statement can be an int

```c++
if ( x = 0 ) // perfectly valid
```

## Single-pass compiler
- as opposed to multi-pass compiler
- mutually recursive functions won't work unless you define a function prototype
        - called a forward declaration in this context

```c++
bool even (int x); // forward declaration
```
